# Travel App Api

Developed a simple RESTful API for a train travel management system as part of a university database course project. 
Built using Java and Spring Framework, the application integrates two databases: PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for storing logs. Features include:
- Browsing connections between various train stations
- Buying tickets for chosen connections
